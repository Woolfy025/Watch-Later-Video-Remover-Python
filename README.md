If you've never used python libraries, you'll need to look up how to install them. This one uses pyautogui, sys, and time. 

You'll want to go to your terminal and type
pip install pyautogui
or 
pip3 install pyautogui 

and then do the same with the other two libraries. After that, you should be golden! Enjoy!
